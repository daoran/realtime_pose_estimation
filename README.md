[//]: # (## Introduction)

This is part of the masterâ€™s thesis: "_A Machine Learning and Point Cloud Processing based Approach for Object Detection 
and Pose Estimation: Design, Implementation, and Validation_", available at [Link to thesis].

By combining an RGB image and point cloud data is the system capable of detecting the object's pose by using object detection,
RANSAC and vector operations. This work is based on the [YOLOX](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX) algorithm and
[Logistics Objects in Context (LOCO)](https://github.com/tum-fml/loco) dataset from 2021 and 2020, respectively.

## Demo Video

[Figure 1](#figure_1) Is a video of the object detection filtering out the pallet of the point cloud. No pose estimation
is performed as the Intel RealSense l515 does not detect the ground of the pallet. This is presented in [Future Work](#future_work).

## Object Detection

The object detection algorithm is the YOLOX-S model from the [YOLOX](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX) repository, which is transfer learned on the 
[LOCO](https://github.com/tum-fml/loco) dataset. The final version is optimized with [Intel OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino) and implemented together
with the pose estimation in C++. [Table 1](#table_1) present the YOLOX-S training results for only pallet.

The YOLOX algorithm has been tested on synthetic pallets in Unreal Engine as shown in [Figure 2](#figure_2).

## Pose Estimation
The pose estimation is performed using the object detection algorithm and point cloud data.

Object detection filters out only the relevant points of the pallet where two RANSAC operations are performed.
The first plane uses only ground floor points, while the remaining pallet points are used for the second plane.
A center vector from the camera is used to find the 3D position where the vector intersects the pallet front plane, 
while the pallet orientation is directly from the estimated front plane. [Figure 3](#figure_3) explains the system 
outputs in the PCL viewer.

### Evaluation Demo Video

The evaluation of the pose estimation system is done with an AprilTag (Type: 25h9), which can directly output its pose using
functions from the OpenCV contrib library. A total of two tests have been performed. Moving test where the camera rotates
around from 0 to -90 degrees and a standstill test where accuracy and precision are evaluated.
The distance from the pallet is two-meter for both tests. [Figure 4](#figure_4) and [Figure 5](#figure_5) links to a video.

## Future Work<a name="future_work"></a>

- Improve the robustness of the system.
- Increasing the range of the pose estimation by using only a single plane and not requiring the ground plane.
- Switch between using the ground plane and not.
- Detecting pallet holes.
- Make all the vector operations in a single matrix operation.
- Add configuration.
